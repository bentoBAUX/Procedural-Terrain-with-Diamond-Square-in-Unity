# Procedural Terrain with Diamond Square in Unity

## Overview
In this project, I implemented the Diamond-Square Algorithm to generate procedural terrains in Unity. The algorithm is a fractal-based technique that creates realistic, randomised heightmaps, perfect for terrains in games and simulations.

To make the tool easier to use, I designed a custom Unity Editor Window. This allows users to configure and generate terrain directly within the editor, removing the need for manual scripting and making the workflow more intuitive.

The tool is functional, but I donâ€™t consider it asset-ready yet. One significant reason is the absence of a loading bar to provide user feedback during terrain generation. Additionally, I feel the UI could be improved to enhance usability. Future revisits would be necessary to refine this project, adding features and improvements to transform it into a polished and user-friendly asset.
